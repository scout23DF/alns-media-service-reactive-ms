# AS Ideas Coding Challenge

The coding challenge is about having a basis for a discussion with you in our technical interview. 
Please work on as much as you personally like in affordable time. You should NOT invest more than 6 hours. 
Please rather deliver less in high quality than more in lesser quality. You are free to skip tasks.

If you are finished with the tasks or have decided that you've spent enough time on it, 
send us an email and tell us where to find your work.

If you encounter any problems, do not hesitate to contact us via replying to our coding-challenge email. 

Your code should be stored in a public git repository with a generic name. Please do not include the descriptions of the tasks in your repository. Others should have fun solving the problems and not copy paste your solution.

Now, if you are ready, jump over to your [tasks](TASKS.md).

We hope you enjoy working on this. Good luck and have fun. :-)
